# AI Project Changelog

This file tracks project changes made by humans, Codex, Claude, Cursor, Copilot, and other AI agents.

## Instructions for AI Agents

- Update this file after every completed task.
- Never remove historical entries.
- Append only.
- Use chronological order for dated entries.
- Add a new date section when the task date is not already present.
- If the current date section already exists, append new bullets under the matching categories.
- If a category has no changes, write `None`.
- Keep entries concise and factual.

## Reusable Entry Template

Copy this structure when starting a new date section:

- Date heading: `## YYYY-MM-DD`
- Required subsections: `Business Changes`, `Database Changes`, `API Changes`, `UI Changes`, `Refactoring`, `Breaking Changes`, `Notes`
- Default bullet when there are no changes: `- None`

### Notes
